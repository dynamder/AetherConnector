Currently in early stages of development. The first usable demo will include:

Potential future plans:

- Safer MCP management (permissions, etc.)
- Basic prompt templates for CyberLife entities
- Visual representations of CyberLife characters with dynamic reactions during conversations
- One-click installation for MCP servers
- Voice synthesis for CyberLife entities
- Group chat feature - Create chat groups with multiple CyberLife entities for collaborative conversations



**Important:** The application icons are entirely created using SD1.5.
